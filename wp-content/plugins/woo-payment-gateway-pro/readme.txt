Braintree For WooCommerce supports many features. In addition to working with the WooCommerce plugin, merchants can also charge for subscriptions using the WooCommerce Subscriptions plugin. If you do not have the WooCommerce Subscription plugin, this plugin supports a feature where a WooCommerce product can be converted to a subscription. This plugin has a donation feature that allows you to capture donation payments by placing short code [braintree_donations] on any page. There are many options that can be customized so that this plugin can best server your business needs. For Braintree Subscriptions, this plugin has support for Webhooks, which takes out the manual process of having to monitor your subscription payments and statuses. You can configure the subscription status that will be applied when the Webhook message is received from Braintree. New in Version 2.3.0 is support for email receipts. By configuring your email settings from within Braintree, you can start sending automatic email receipts to your customers. If you accept multiple currencies, this plugin integrates with the WooCommerce Currency plugin, allowing you to settle your transactions in multiple currencies.

the form to contain a list of payment amounts, simply add the following shortcode and include the index and amount. <strong>[braintree_donations 1="1" 2="2" 3="3" 4="5" 5="10"]</strong>. If you only want one price to be allowed, only inlcude one index <strong>[braintree_donations 1="55"]</strong>.
