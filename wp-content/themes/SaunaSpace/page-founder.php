        <p>In 2008 SaunaSpace founder Brian needed to make a decision: fill prescriptions for acne, insomnia, and adrenal fatigue, or take a chance with Near Infrared (NIr) Sauna Therapy, as recommended by an alternative medicine doctor. For Brian, it was a no brainer. But there was a problem, at the time you couldn’t find a NIr sauna.  So, he began his journey to change that.</p>

          <p>A born tinkerer, Brian cobbled together his first sauna from scavenged parts and chicken wire. Within days of NIr Sauna Therapy, his insomnia vanished. But Brian also began to notice something strange. A brain fog, which he hadn’t been aware of, lifted - Brian started thinking clearer and quicker than ever before. With continued treatment his acne and adrenal fatigue disappeared as well.</p>

          <h3 class="header2">A VISION FOR<br><span>NATURAL HEALING</span></h3>
          <p>Over the following years Brian became consumed with creating the perfect product, fueled by the healing transformation of his personal experience with NIr Sauna Therapy. At the beginning, SaunaSpace was one big DIY project, where Brian did everything from designing his logo and website to building every sauna himself.<br><br> With so much to do, Brian brought in his trusted friends Rusty as Lead Design and Tony for Chief Ops to accelerate SaunaSpace Product & Production Development.
          Today, Brian heads our ten-person team that operates 3,500 square feet of workshop space spread over two locations. As SaunaSpace continues to grow, Brian is just as fervently tinkering in his passionate quest to spread the power of NIr Sauna Therapy.</p>
